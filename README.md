## üìÇ Project Structure  

- **`DAL` (Data Access Layer)**  
  - Contains all domain models such as `ApplicationUser`, `Post`, `Comment`, `Like`, `Category`, and `Report`.  
  - Includes the database context (`DbContext`) and all database-related operations using Entity Framework Core.  

- **`BLL` (Business Logic Layer)**  
  - Encapsulates all query and business logic operations.  
  - Implements the **Repository Design Pattern** to separate data access logic from the controllers.  
  - Handles interactions between the `DAL` and the `PL`.  

- **`PL` (Presentation Layer)**  
  - Contains the `wwwroot` folder for static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.  
  - Includes the **Areas**:  
    - **`User`**: For user-specific features, such as profile management, creating posts, comments, likes, and following other users.  
    - **`Admin`**: For admin-specific features, including handling reports, managing categories.  
  - Hosts all main controllers, views, and Razor pages to create the user interface.  
  - Manages shared controllers, such as `AccountController` for identity-related actions and `HomeController` for Home pages.  

### **Architecture**  
The project follows a **N-tier Architecture**:  
1. **Presentation Layer (PL)**: Handles user interactions through areas, controllers, and views.  
2. **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**: Processes and validates business logic, ensuring a clear separation between the UI and database operations.  
3. **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: Manages all database-related tasks, including migrations and database context.
